## Project 1: Do we really enjoy spending time with our family?

### [Project Description](doc/)
Using the provided scripts for processing the HappyDB data, I investigated how prevalent "family-oriented" moments are, the categories of these moments, who experiences these moments, and whether or not certain family members were greater sources of happiness than others. The directory structure of this project is slightly modified, and is formatted as follows:

```
proj/
├── data/
├── doc/
├── figs/


```

Please see each subfolder for a README file.
