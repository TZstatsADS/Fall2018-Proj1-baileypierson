# ADS Project 1
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the data processing (Text_Processing.Rmd), reporting (Project.Rmd), and presentation (Project1.html) files.  

NOTE: Text_Processing.Rmd has been modified just slightly so that output is save into the data directory rather than creating an output folder.
